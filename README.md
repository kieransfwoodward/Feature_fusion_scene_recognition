# Feature_fusion_scene_recognition

This repository contains a Python notebook implementing a feature fusion multi-model approach for scene recognition. The project leverages deep learning models to combine features from different modalities to improve scene classification accuracy.

## Overview

Scene recognition is a challenging task in computer vision that involves classifying the context or environment depicted in an image. This project employs a multi-model approach to fuse features extracted from different neural network architectures, enhancing the model's ability to recognise various scenes.

## Features

Utilises convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
Combines features from multiple models to improve classification performance.
Implements techniques such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
